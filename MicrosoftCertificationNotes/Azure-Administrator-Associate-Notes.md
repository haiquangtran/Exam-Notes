## Microsoft Learning Module Notes
- **Securing Data**
  - Cloud secruity is a shared responsibility
    - IaaS: still have to patch/secure OS & software and secure network.
      - Security advantage of having outsourced conern over protecting physical network
    - PaaS: outsources a lot of security concerns. Security for OS and software is outsourced. Can still control stuff in Azure Portal.
    - SaaS: outsources everything.
  - You always retain responsibility for securing the following:
    - Data
    - Endpoints
    - Accounts
    - Access management
  - **Defense in depth (Layered approach)**
    - Strategy to slow the advance of an attack trying to get unauthorized access to info.
    - Each layer provides protection, if one is breached then there is another layer as a safe net etc.
      - Can provide alert telemtry that can be acted upon 
    - Microsoft applies a layered approach to security, both in physical data centers and across Azure services
  - **Layers:**
    - **Data**
      - Almost all attackers are after this (DB, disk inside VM, etc)
    - **Application**
      - Store sensitive application in a secure storage medium
    - **Compute**
      - Secure access to VMs
      - Implement endpoint protection
      - Keep systems patched and current
    - **Networking**
      - Secure outbound/inbound internet access by limiting to only what is needed
      - Limit communication between resources
      - Deny by default
      - Implement secure connectivity to on-premises networks.
    - **Perimeter**
      - Use DDoS protection to filter large-scale attacks
      - Use perimeter firewalls to identify and alert malicious attacks against network
      - Protect from network-based attacks against your resources
    - **Identity and Access**
      - Control access to infrastructure and change control
      - Use SSO and multi-factor auth
      - Audit events & changes
    - **Physical security**
      - Controlling access to hardware within data center is first line of defence

- **Azure Security Center**
  - Monitoring service for threat protection across all services in Azure, and on-premises. 
  - **Can do the following:**
    - Security recommendations
    - Monitor security settings and apply required security to new services as they come online 
    - Monitor all services and perform automatic security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities
    - Use ML to detect and block malware from being installed
    - Identify potential inbound attacks
    - JIT access control for ports
  - **Available tiers**
    - Free - Limited to assessments and recommendations of Azure resources only.
    - Standard - full suite of security related services: continous monitoring, threat detction, JIT access control for ports etc
