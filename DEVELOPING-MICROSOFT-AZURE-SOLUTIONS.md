# Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions

## Sections of the exam
## **Create and manage Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Virtual Machines**
  - Virtual Machines
    - Manage through Portal, PowerShell (mainly for DevOps) or REST API.
    - Consists of Virtual Network, a Cloud Service wrapper with a Virtual Machine in that wrapper, with a storage account that contains an Image, OS Disk, and Data Disk(s).
  - Deployment
    - Do it in the Azure market place.
    - Can select existing VM images
    - Can use PowerShell and deploy using PowerShell too
    - There are also JSON ARM Templates which allow for intelliSense and fast set up
  - ARM Templates Portal 
    - Custom deployment allows you to create a template from scratch
  - Desired State Configuration
    - Allows you to preset/set the VM to a desired state
    - Usually will be seen in the template.
  - Uploading Images
    - Create a custom image from an existing machine using Sys prep or the system preparation tool
    - This allows you to create a template of an existing machine that we can continue to use within Azure as a new virtual machine
  - Availability Sets
    - Availability sets are NOT created by default
    - You have to create the Availability Set WITH the virtual machine
    - VMs may be impacted by unplanned outages such as power cuts, networks etc. Or during planned maintenance, we need to understand were patching the underlying host OS. These will run as a VM but we yet we still need to patch the Host we still need the VMs to be available. When you create a availability set you will have upgrade domains and fault domains. 
    - Planned vs unplanned maintenance
      - Configure multiple VMs in an availability set for redundancy
      - Configure each application tier into separate availability sets
      - Combine a Load Balancer with availability sets
      - Use multiple storage accounts for each availability set
    - Upgrade domains
      - Is for underlying patching
      - Five (non-user configurable) domains by default
      - Groups of VMs and hardware that can be rebooted at the same time
    - Fault domains
      - Separate hardware & network (Incase of a network switch, or power outage, or hardware failure)
      - Three domains by default
      - Group of VMs that share a common power source and network switch 
  - Storage replication options
    - Locally redundant
	  - Default
	  - up to 3 nodes in same data center
	- Zone redundant storage
	  - up to 3 data centers in the same region
	- Geo-redundant storage
	  - Data center in a different region
	- Read-access geo-redundant storage

    - User Defined Routes (UDRs) / Route tables
      - Specify the next hop for packets flowing to a specific subnet
      - Force tunnelling to the internet via your on-premises network
      - Network Virtual Appliance

      - Initial scale setting using ARM template: "sku" : { "name" : "Standard_A0", "tier": "Standard", "capcity": 3 }
        - Can configure a Vms scale set's scaling capabilites in the template.
## **Design and implement a storage and data strategy**
  - Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database are important in Microsoft Azure PaaS strategy for storage. 
  - Azure Storage 
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-introduction#what-is-azure-storage
    - Enables storage and retrieval of large amounts of unstructured data
    - Documents, media in the Blob service, Table service for NoSQL data, queue service for reliable messages, file service for server message block file share scenarios. 
  - Azure SQL Database
    - Provides classic relational database features as part of an elastic scale service. 
  - Storage
  	- Blobs / Files 
  	  - A blob is acced from a container within a storage account. From there, we actually access the particular blob. 
  	  - A SAS token is the gateway that allows us with security to access our particular blob. (Like a valet key in a car that allows you to access a particular storage location)
  	  - Types
	  	  - Block Blob
	  	  - Page Blob
	  	  - Append Blob
	  - Files
	    - Files are accessible via SMB interface as a file share
	    - Can also access those files using the RESTful APIs
	  - Azure Blobs vs Azure Files
	    - Accessibility: Blob = REST APIs, Files = REST APIs, or SMB interface
	    - Endpoints: Blob = myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob, Files = myaccount.file.core.windows.net\myshare\myfile.txt
	    - Capacity: Blob = Up to 500TB containers, Files = 5TB file shares
	    - Throughput: Blob = Up to 60 MB/s per blob, Files = Up to 60 MB/ps per share
	    - Billed capacity: Blob = based on bytes written, Files = based on file size
  	- Tables
  	  - Uses ODATA interface or a TableClient to interface with the Table storage
  	  - Uses an account that has tables, which has individual entities within it - you access the entities
  	  - Uses a SAS token as a gateway into the account for security
  	- Queues
  	  - QueueClient which interfaces to the Queue storage
  	  - Stored within an account, within a table, within a entities (entities are inside the queue)
  	  - Uses a SAS token as a gateway into the account for security 
  	- Redis Cache
  	  - Tiers: Basic, Standard & Premium
  	  - Concurrency
  	    - Optimistic vs pessimistic
  	  - Distributed app caching

  	  - SQL DB maintains global mapping information about all shards (DBs) in a shard set
  	  - Metadata used to route based on sharding key
  	- Search
  	  - Index: Persistent store of documents
  	  - Add data (Push JSON data with .NET SDK or REST API, Pull with indexers supporting Azure sotrage and .NET SDK or REST API)
  	  - Handle Results
  	    - Total hits and page counts
  	    - Layout results
  	    - Sorting and filtering
  - Access control with Shared Access Signature (SAS)
    - Application requests a SAS Token from the SAS Service
    - SAS Token gets generated and gets handed to Application
    - Application then makes a storage request to Azure Storage with the SAS Token
    - Azure Storage responds
  - Storage Access
    - Access through RESTFUL api:
    - Blobs: //[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]/[blob]
    - Files: //[account].file.core.windows.net/[file]
    - Tables: //[account].table.core.windows.net/[table]([paritition key], [row key])
    - Queues: //[account].queue.core.windows.net/[queue]
  - Azure Storage Service Encruption (SSE)
    - Features
      - 256 BIT AES Encryption 
      - Block, Page and Append Blobs
      - General purpose and Blob Storage Accounts
      - All redundancy levels and all regions
      - Only applicable for ARM, not ASM
    - Limitations
      - The following are not encryped:
	      - Classic storage and classic migrated are not included. 
	      - Existing data before turned on is not included. 
	      - Tables, Queues, and Files data 
	  - i.e. If you want the encryption you have to enable it at the beginning right away.
